    <div>  Bukowski lived most of his life in Los Angeles. He briefly attended Los Angeles City College (1939–41) and worked at menial jobs while writing short stories, the first of which were published in the mid-1940s. After a 10-year period during which he abandoned writing and traveled across the U.S. living the life of a destitute alcoholic drifter, he returned to Los Angeles and began publishing poetry in 1955. Beginning with Flower, Fist and Bestial Wail (1959), volumes of his poetry appeared almost annually via small underground publishing houses. By 1963, the year he published It Catches My Heart in Its Hands—a collection of poetry about alcoholics, prostitutes, losing gamblers, and down-and-out people—Bukowski had a loyal following. Notable later poetry collections include Mockingbird Wish Me Luck (1972), Love Is a Dog from Hell (1977), War All the Time (1984), and You Get So Alone at Times That It Just Makes Sense (1986). Though he had begun his career as one of the ultimate “cult authors,” his work was so popular and influential that by the time of his death he was one of the best-known American authors and an established part of the 20th-century literary canon. Bukowski was such a prolific writer that his production outstripped his own life span; numerous collections of his previously unpublished poetry appeared posthumously, such as Slouching Toward Nirvana (2005) and The People Look Like Flowers At Last (2007).</div>

    <div>Bukowski’s short stories and novels are unsparingly realistic and usually comic. They often observe the thoughts and actions of Bukowski’s alter ego Henry Chinaski, a hard-drinking unskilled worker, a lover of classical music, and a gambler on the horses. Collections of his stories include Notes of a Dirty Old Man (1969), taken from his underground newspaper column of that name, Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness (1972), and Hot Water Music (1983). His later novels include Post Office (1971), Factotum (1975), and Ham on Rye (1982). Hollywood (1989), also a novel, took as its subject the filming of the 1987 motion picture Barfly, a semiautobiographical comedy about alcoholic lovers on skid row for which Bukowski wrote the screenplay (published 1984). The novel Pulp was published posthumously in 1994.</div>
